Where Should I submit?
-----
Researchers often wonder a simple question - *Where do I submit my work*? 
The answer depends on many factors, but ultimately you want to submit your work to a **top quality journal**. 

That is great, but *how do your judge the quality of a journal*?
There are many answer to this question, and nothing replaces recomendations of your top peers and your advisors. 
* You should seek out their advice. 
* You should look where they are publishing on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/). 
* Look at the editoral board and advisory boards - make sure the top people in the field are on it.


This Ranking attempts to take 5 qualitative metrics : SNIP, SJR, IF, 5-year IF, and H-indexd. (I am not going to argue which is a better ranking, every school and department has their own formula - good for them.) There are others I am leaving out, but might add later. 

This is a rough guide to help you compose a list to help you learn *where should I submit?*

Ranking Information
----------

- **Source Normalized Impact per Paper (SNIP):** Source Normalized Impact per Paper (SNIP) measures contextual citation impact by weighting citations based on the total number of citations in a subject field. The impact of a single citation is given higher value in subject areas where citations are less likely, and vice versa. t is defined as the ratio of a journal's citation count per paper and the citation potential in its subject field. It aims to allow direct comparison of sources in different subject fields. Citation potential is shown to vary not only between journal subject categories – groupings of journals sharing a research field – or disciplines (e.g., journals in Mathematics, Engineering and Social Sciences tend to have lower values than titles in Life Sciences), but also between journals within the same subject category. 

  
- **SCImago Journal Rank (SJR):** SCImago Journal Rank (SJR indicator) is a measure of scientific influence of scholarly journals that accounts for both the number of citations received by a journal and the importance or prestige of the journals where such citations come from. The SJR indicator is a variant of the eigenvector centrality measure used in network theory. Such measures establish the importance of a node in a network based on the principle that connections to high-scoring nodes contribute  more to the score of the node. The SJR indicator, which is inspired by the PageRank algorithm, has been developed to be used in extremely large and heterogeneous journal citation networks. It is a size-independent indicator and its values order journals by their "average prestige per article" and can be used for journal comparisons in science evaluation processes.

- **Impact Factor (IF):** The impact factor (IF) of an academic journal is a measure reflecting the average number of citations to recent articles published in the journal. It is frequently used as a proxy for the relative importance of a journal within its field, with journals with higher impact factors deemed to be more important than those with lower ones. 

- **5 year - Impact Factor (IF):** The impact factor (IF) of an academic journal is a measure reflecting the average number of citations to recent articles published in the journal. It is frequently used as a proxy for the relative importance of a journal within its field, with journals with higher impact factors deemed to be more important than those with lower ones based over 5 years. 

- **H index:** The h-index is an index that attempts to measure both the productivity and citation impact of the published body of work of a scientist or scholar. The index is based on the set of the scientist's most cited papers and the number of citations that they have received in other publications.
